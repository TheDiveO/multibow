-- luacheck: globals mb tick


-- Tick gets called by the Keybow "firmware" every 1ms (or so). If any timers
-- have gone off by now, then call their timer user functions. Keybow's tick
-- ms counter has its epoch set when the Keybow Lua scripting started (so it's
-- not a *nix timestamp or such). In addition to timers, we also handle queued
-- ticking keys jobs here: these are always processed in sequence, and each
-- such ticking key job may consume multiple ticks until it has finished its
-- job.
function tick(now)
    mb.now = now
    while true do
        local next, tim = mb.timers:peek()
        if next == nil or now < next then
            break
        end
        mb.timers:remove()
        tim:trigger(now)
    end
    mb.tq:process(now)
end
