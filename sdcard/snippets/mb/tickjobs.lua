-- Multibow's tick jobs are processed in the "background", but synchronously
-- with each tick() of the Keybow firmware. Normally, tick()s will happen
-- every 1ms, but might get skipped in case some Keybow Lua script/function
-- run for a longer time, delaying the next tick.
--
-- 1. Tick jobs are always run one after another, but never in parallel; thus,
--    only at most one tick job can be active at any given time. In this
--    sense, repeated and hierarchical tick jobs are also considered to be in
--    sequence and never to be parallel.
--
-- 2. A single tick job can run for as many ticks it needs to carry out its
--    task. Multibow will call the active's process() method for each tick
--    until it signals defeat, erm, completion by returning a (delay) value of
--    <0. When process() returns a value >=0, then this is the amount of ms
--    (ticks) to delay the call to process() on the next time. That is, 0
--    means "on the next tick", 1 means "on the next but one tick".
--
-- 3. The start of a tick job can be delayed by a certain amount of ms
--    (ticks), if needed.
--
-- 4. Tick jobs commonly define a constructor called "new(...)" to create new
--    tick jobs of a particular type.
--
-- 5. Multibow's tick job architecture expects tick jobs to always provide
--    these two methods for correct operation: process() and reset(). As
--    mentioned above, process() gets called so that a tick job can carry out
--    its next slice of task until it's done. And reset() resets a tick job to
--    its initial state so that it can be repeated.
--
-- 6. Tick jobs can carry out subjobs, but that's hidden to Multibow and just
--    the internal business of such tick jobs. However, such subjobs need to
--    be stored in a "tickjob" field of a tick job; this is necessary so the
--    chaining operators can do their dirty work correctly.


-- Tick job mappers execute a series of tick'ered function calls, passing the
-- function(s) each one of a sequence of things with each tick until done. So,
-- tick job mappers are like array mappers, but this time they're broken into
-- discrete ticks. And since we sometimes need to do multiple ticked steps per
-- element, our tick job mappers can also work on sequences of functions to be
-- called for each element.
